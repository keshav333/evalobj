- 26 May 2020. Design change to orthogonalise question types and quiz types.
  Explanation: Currently, we have two types of questions: MCQ and MTF, and two
  types of quizzes: simple and jumbled. Both question types and quiz types are
  expected to grow in number. It should be convenient to do so. For this, it is
  necessary that they can grow independent of each other, i.e. adding a new
  question type shouldn't need to know the quiz types currently available. 
  Similarly, adding a new quiz type shouldn't require accounting for the
  question types currently present.

- 13 May 2020. Update the documentation to reflect the updates done till 13 May 2020.
  Status: OPEN

- 05 May 2020. Create a new question type: Grouped. This allows generation of jumbled
  quiz among items grouped into one.
  Status: OPEN

- 05 May 2020. Create a new question type: Single Word. 
  Status: OPEN

- 05 May 2020. Correct the implementation of MTF.

- 03 May 2020. Modify setup.py to deal with both types of quizzes: simple and jumbled.
  Right now, it just does it for jumbled quizzes. A good approach seems to be to
  implement simple quizzes as special case of jumbled quiz, with
  "number of assessment instruments" : "1",
  "number of questions per question paper" : number of items in the item bank,
  "number of question papers per assessment instrument" : "1",

- 13 May 2020. Move the tex files to their own directory, say 'tex'.

- 07 May 2020. Move the files which get copied verbatim into the asessment
  directory (e.g. gen_jumbled.py, gen_simple.py, gen_pdf.sh, evaluate.py)
  from the application directory into a separate subdirectory,
  say 'boilerplate'. This will clean up the source directory by retaining
  only code and seggregate the same from code/script that gets copied into
  the assessment directory.
  Make corresponding changes to the source code.

- 05 May 2020. For jumbled quiz, get rid of RNtoAI mapping too. Directly generate 
  one assessment instrument for each roll number. Possibly change the AItoIBI mapping
  to RNtoIBI mapping.
  Status: CLOSED

- 03 May 2020. Replacing 3-step process in jumbled quiz with 2-step process.
  The change will simplify the process (and the code). In this, there will be
  no more 'questions', only 'assessment instruments'.
