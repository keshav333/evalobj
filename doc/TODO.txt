- 07 May 2020. Move the files which get copied verbatim into the asessment
  directory (e.g. gen_jumbled.py, gen_simple.py, gen_pdf.sh, evaluate.py)
  from the application directory into a separate subdirectory,
  say 'boilerplate'. This will clean up the source directory by retaining
  only code and seggregate the same from code/script that gets copied into
  the assessment directory.
  Make corresponding changes to the source code.
  Status: DONE (TESTING PENDING)
  
- 05 May 2020. For jumbled quiz, get rid of RNtoAI mapping too. Directly generate 
  one assessment instrument for each roll number. Possibly change the AItoIBI mapping
  to RNtoIBI mapping.
  Status: OPEN

- 05 May 2020. Create a new question time: Grouped. This allows generation of jumbled
  quiz among items grouped into one.
  Status: OPEN

- 05 May 2020. Create a new question type: Single Word. 
  Status: OPEN

- 03 May 2020. Modify setup.py to deal with both types of quizzes: simple and jumbled.
  Right now, it just does it for jumbled quizzes. A good approach seems to be to
  implement simple quizzes as special case of jumbled quiz, with
  "number of assessment instruments" : "1",
  "number of questions per question paper" : number of items in the item bank,
  "number of question papers per assessment instrument" : "1", 
  Status: OPEN

- 03 May 2020. Replacing 3-step process in jumbled quiz with 2-step process.
  The change will simplify the process (and the code). In this, there will be
  no more 'questions', only 'assessment instruments'.
