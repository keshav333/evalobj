- 03 May 2020. Modify setup.py to deal with both types of quizzes: simple and jumbled.
  Right now, it just does it for jumbled quizzes. A good approach seems to be to
  implement simple quizzes as special case of jumbled quiz, with
  "number of assessment instruments" : "1",
  "number of questions per question paper" : number of items in the item bank,
  "number of question papers per assessment instrument" : "1", 
  Status: OPEN

- 03 May 2020. Replacing 3-step process in jumbled quiz with 2-step process.
  The change will simplify the process (and the code). In this, there will be
  no more 'questions', only 'assessment instruments'.
