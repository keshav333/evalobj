  "number of assessment instruments" : "1",
  "number of questions per question paper" : number of items in the item bank,
  "number of question papers per assessment instrument" : "1", 

- src/evaluate_simple.py
- Answer editor - GUI application for easy editing of answers both for the evaluator and for the student.
- Configuration editor - GUI application for easy editing of assessment project configuration
